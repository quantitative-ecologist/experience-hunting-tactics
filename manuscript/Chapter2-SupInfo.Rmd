need to talk about priors here for the gamms etc

```{r figS1, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "**Figure S1.** Among individual differences in the development of hunting expertise. The predators' hunting success (i.e. the probability of capturing the four prey) is on the y axis, and the predators' cumulative experience (i.e. the number of matches played prior to each observation) is on the x axis. Each fitted curve represents an individual predator. (A) Individuals with the greatest increase in hunting success with experience (B) Individuals with the greatest decrease in hunting success with experience."}
