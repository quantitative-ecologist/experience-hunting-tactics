need to talk about priors here for the gamms etc

```{r tableS1, ft.align = "left"}

tab1 <- readRDS(here::here("outputs", "05_outputs_tables", "05_table1.rds"))

set_caption(
  tab1,
  caption = "Posterior mean values, standard errors, and 95% credible intervals for the GAMM with a common global smoother. The values are presented on the logit scale.",
  style = "Table Caption"
)
