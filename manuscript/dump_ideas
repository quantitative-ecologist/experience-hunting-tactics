A potential consequence of among-individual differences in foraging behavior is that they can lead to individual differences in the type of prey captured (i.e. individual niche specialization) [Woo et al., 2008, sources]. There may thus exist a functional relationship linking individual foraging specialisation to specialisation in resource consumption [sources: Toscano et al. 2016, etc, michalko et gibbons, Kerr, Tinker, Bowen]. 

For instance, predators species often use stereotyped hunting techniques required to capture the type of prey they encounter, such as (dauphins, orcas, etc) [sources : Woo, Estes, tinker, etc]. However, it remains largely unclear *accent sur le fait que on est pas sur les mécanismes qui associe la proie à la tactique*
