A potential consequence of among-individual differences in foraging behavior is that they can lead to individual differences in the type of prey captured (i.e. individual niche specialization) [Woo et al., 2008, sources]. There may thus exist a functional relationship linking individual foraging specialisation to specialisation in resource consumption [sources: Toscano et al. 2016, etc, michalko et gibbons, Kerr, Tinker, Bowen]. 

For instance, predators species often use stereotyped hunting techniques required to capture the type of prey they encounter, such as (dauphins, orcas, etc) [sources : Woo, Estes, tinker, etc]. However, it remains largely unclear *accent sur le fait que on est pas sur les mécanismes qui associe la proie à la tactique* 

(travailler ceci) An important question that remains unanswered is how can generalist and specialist individuals coexist within predator populations. If foraging and resource specialisation can help maintain community stability by promoting species coexistence [sources: bolnick, araujo, wolf, etc], it is crucial that we develop studies that integrate the causes and consequences of these two individual components. Several studies have shown that individual specialists can outperform.

If expertise is a mechanism driving individual specialization, then it wouldn't explain why field studies often find that foraging specialists and generalists have similar hunting success irrespective of their age [@Woo.etal2008]. *(ne peut pas être séparé de l'interaction car c'ets ce qui drive l'apprentissage)*
